      <description>Recently I ran into this wonderful article published in Nature Biotechnology written by Nick Loman and Mick Watson, about how to become a good computational biologist. The article is so brilliant that I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write about it in my (actual) first post.
Youâ€™re a scientist, not a programmer  The perfect is the enemy of the good. Remember you are a scientist and the quality of your research is what is important, not how pretty your source code looks.</description>

      <description>Hosting my first Blog with Hugo on Github!
For a starter, I&amp;rsquo;ll document in this post how the blog is managed and used. I&amp;rsquo;ve setup the site by referring to here, here, and here.
The first link is particularly useful. I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted its file structure for setting up privately managed (/blog) and public sites (/public). Critically, the /public repo must be created with the following convention: https://github.com/RuiyuRayWang/ruiyuraywang.github.io Everytime contents in /blog is updated, run hugo -D to generate new site to /public and push /public to github accordingly.</description>
