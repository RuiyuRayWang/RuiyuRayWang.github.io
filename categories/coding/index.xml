      <description>Previously I wrote about how to build multiple R versions on Ubuntu and how to switch versions.
/post/mult-r/ It turns out that my &amp;ldquo;old school&amp;rdquo; move (ln -s) is outdated. Now there are many handy tools to do the job for you.
RSwitch is based on macOS. I&amp;rsquo;m using it personally, simply because I used it before and don&amp;rsquo;t want to bother changing gear.
rig supports multiple platforms and is probably the best choice for most users.</description>

      <description>Building Environments for Cellassign and CellBLAST with multiple Tensorflow (GPU) Versions on Ubuntu As promised, I will write about my experience with installing tensorflow.
Why did I ever have to build Tensorflow myself?
The reason is that I was trying to use two tools: cellassign and Cell_BLAST, but they depend on different tensorflow versions. To make them both work, I used the following build strategy that allows different Tensorflow versions installed and run in separate conda environments.</description>

      <description>Clean Built of Multiple R Versions on Ubuntu Long time ago I built R-4.0.3 on Ubuntu system following these guides: link1, link2. Briefly, I added GPG Key to APT (Advanced Package Tool) and added CRAN repository and directly retrieved R by apt.
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 $ sudo add-apt-repository &#39;deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/&#39; $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install r-base Recently, I ran into an issue with cellassign when analyzing single cell datasets.</description>
