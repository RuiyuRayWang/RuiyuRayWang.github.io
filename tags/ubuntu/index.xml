      <title>Building Environments for Cellassign and CellBLAST with multiple GPU Supported Tensorflow Versions on Ubuntu</title>

      <description>As promised, I will write about my experience with installing tensorflow.
Why did I ever have to build Tensorflow myself?
The reason is that I was trying to use two tools: cellassign and Cell_BLAST, but they depend on different tensorflow versions. To make them both work, I used the following build strategy that allows different Tensorflow versions installed and run in separate conda environments.

      <title>Clean Built of Multiple R Versions on Ubuntu</title>

      <description>Long time ago I built R-4.0.3 on Ubuntu system following these guides: link1, link2. Briefly, I added GPG Key to APT (Advanced Package Tool) and added CRAN repository and directly retrieved R by apt.
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9 $ sudo add-apt-repository &#39;deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/&#39; $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install r-base Recently, I ran into an issue with cellassign when analyzing single cell datasets. I suspected that reverting to previous R versions might resolve the problem.</description>
