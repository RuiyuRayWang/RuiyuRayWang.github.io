      <description>Building Environments for Cellassign and CellBLAST with multiple Tensorflow (GPU) Versions on Ubuntu As promised, I will write about my experience with installing tensorflow.
Why did I ever have to build Tensorflow myself?
The reason is that I was trying to use two tools: cellassign and Cell_BLAST, but they depend on different tensorflow versions. To make them both work, I used the following build strategy that allows different Tensorflow versions installed and run in separate conda environments.</description>
